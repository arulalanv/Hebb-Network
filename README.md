# Hebb-Network
Design a Hebb Network to classify English alphabets 'I' and 'O' using MATLAB.
Hebbian learning rule is one of the earliest and the simplest learning rules for the neural networks. It was proposed by Donald Hebb. Hebb proposed that if two interconnected neurons are both “on” at the same time, then the weight between them should be increased. Hebbian network is a single layer neural network which consists of one input layer with many input units and one output layer with one output unit. This architecture is usually used for pattern classification.
